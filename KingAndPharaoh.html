In addition, this helped me learn that subclasses do not inherit superclass variables, but do inherit methods, as I originally copied all the methods from the superclass and put them into the subclass in addition to its unique methods.
    <br><br>Objective: To demonstrate an understanding of super- and subclasses, as well as the transfer of methods and variables between them, using three classes.
    <br><br>The King class creates the template for a typical king. His attributes consist of his name, territory ruled over, army size, nation name, number of castles under his possession, whether or not he is married, and the number of prisoners he has. The pharaoh's extra attributes would be the number of pyramids, the vizier (the person second-in-command to the pharaoh), the name of their burial grounds, and the dynasty in which they ruled. In terms of behaviours, or methods, accessors and mutators are provided for each attribute, as well as some extra ones which conquer territory, release all prisoners, or release territory.
