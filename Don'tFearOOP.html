        <font size = 4><br><div class = "redText">Reflection: At first, I did not understand how to make an object of the class, but then I learned about driver classes (in this case the CoffeeDrinking class), which, in their main methods, create any necessary objects and execute functions. Overall, though, this assignment helped me understand the aspects of a proper program using OOP for the first time. I understood the basic structure of a program, with variables as attributes and methods as behaviours. Accessors and mutators became clear, as well as the concept of inheritance with subclasses.</div>
