                Hi there! I am a grade 10 student attending AP Computer Science at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute. This is my programming portfolio. On this website, you will find up-to-date tutorials and sample assignments that I complete throughout the course.</font></div></center></p></font>

   My portfolio is split up into sections for each of the most important topics covered in the course. Each section has sample assignments, an informational powerpoint explaining the topic, an example  with explanation or problem with a step-by-step solution, and a few important tips to consider when dealing with each concept. For each of my sample assignments, I describe any mistakes I made and strategies I used to solve the problem given. To learn more about me and my achievements, visit the "About Me" page, and if you would like to reach out, visit the "Contact" page to get in touch.</center></div>
