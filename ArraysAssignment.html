    <font size = 4>Reflection: To solve this problem, I knew that I would have to read input, so I quickly learned how to use the Scanner class to input data from a file. Once this was done, I knew that I would have to find a sort to utilise, and after a bit of research, found that insertion sort is effective on small lists of data. Thus, I decided to use it for both attributes when sorting the students. A problem I experienced with this assignment was that the StudentMarksA class was the only one which could read in from the file. Thus, I decided to make a read () method inside of it, and used it as a superclass for the other two classes, calling the read method from them. This automatically gave me the data I needed to work with, leaving me with just the sort to implement.
    <br><br>Objective: To effectively read in and sort a list of names and grades based on both attributes.
    <br><br>The StudentMarksA class reads in a list of names and according grades into two arrays, then prints out the sets of data 5 spaces apart. The StudentMarksB class uses an insertion sort to sort the students and their grades by name from A to Z. Finally, the StudentMarksC class also uses an insertion sort, but this time to sort the students by grade. PLEASE SCROLL DOWN FOR INPUT FILE!
