    <font size = 4>Reflection: This presentation really helped me understand insertion sort in a thorough fashion, and as is often said, the best way to demonstrate knowledge is to teach others, which is what I did.
    <br><br>Objective: To clearly and concisely explain the specifics of insertion sort, such as time complexity, cautions, and when to use it. In addition, at least one real-life and one code example had to have been shown.
    <br><br>The InsertionSort class shows a very basic template for insertion sort, using integers in an array. Of course, the sort can be revised to work in other situations. The VisualInsertionSort class, when run, shows a more visual example of the sort. In the picture it displays, the green square represents the current key, the blue represents the last square that was put in its correct position, and the red are all of the squares not being used currently.
