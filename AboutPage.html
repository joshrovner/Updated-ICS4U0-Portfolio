                From a young age, I have been fascinated with STEM subjects, facilitiating my love for math throughout my educational career, attending an extracurricular math program from the age of 8. I started coding in 5th grade with a simple Khan Academy tutorial on JavaScript. In grade 9, I completed a full course in Turing, as an introduction to programming. I have been coding in Java since September 2018, from the start of my Grade 11 Computer Science course. In terms of personality, I can be classified as an "ISTJ", which means that I have am introverted. But, I am a hard-working and responsible student, which is reflected in my academic success. When solving problems, I try to plan my time and create step-by-step solutions, ensuring that I remember each major change I made. On the side, I am passionate about sports, having played tennis and baseball at a provincial level. In fact, I've represented my school on its badminton and tennis teams, advancing to regional championships for badminton.
