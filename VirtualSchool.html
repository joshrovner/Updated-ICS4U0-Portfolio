    <br><font size = 4>Reflection: At first, I found this assignment to be quite difficult. I struggled with the Locker class as I wasn't sure how to make a student take a book from their locker or put one back, and the same applied to the jacket. After analyzing what was supposed to happen, I understood that when the student took something out of the locker, the locker value for the object would have to be set to null, and the student would get a copy of the object. Then, I applied the same strategy for a student putting something into their locker, but vice versa. In addition, I struggled with giving the student possession of a book, as in some cases the student didn't have the book with them or in their locker. To solve this, I emulated the office giving the student a book by instantiating a new book in the student's array of books.
    <br><br>Objective: To simulate a school where a student tries to enter a classroom. If they have the correct book, they have a locker, and their jacket is in their locker, they are allowed to enter. Otherwise, the student will either be sent to the office or back to their locker depending on the issue.
    <br><br>Each respective class simply creates a basic template for the object they represent. Notably, the Locker class employs methods such as getABook, putABook, getJacket, and putJacket, which transfer ownership of items. Also, the ClassRoom class has the enter() method, which checks if the student can enter and if they cannot, deals with the issue. Finally, the VirtualSchool is essentially a driver class which performs all the tasks and prints out any actions in real-time.
